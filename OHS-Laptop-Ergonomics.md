Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?  
Working directly on a laptop often leads to slouching, bent neck posture, and awkward wrist positioning. Over time, this can cause musculoskeletal strain, repetitive stress injuries, and eye fatigue.  

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop?
Laptop stands to raise the screen to eye level.  
External keyboards and mice to maintain neutral wrist posture.  
Ergonomic chairs with lumbar support to encourage upright posture.  
Footrests or adjustable desks for added comfort and support.  

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup? 
- The top of the monitor should be at or slightly below eye level.  
- The chair height should allow feet to rest flat on the ground, with knees bent at ~90 degrees.  
- Elbows should rest comfortably at desk height, close to the body.  
- Maintain at least an arm’s length distance between eyes and the screen.  

What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use?
- Take movement breaks every 30–60 minutes.  
- Do quick posture checks to avoid slouching.  
- Practice the 20-20-20 rule for eye health (look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes).  
- Stretch wrists, shoulders, and neck regularly.  

What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?
I can use a laptop stand to raise my screen to eye level and connect an external keyboard and mouse to reduce wrist strain. Adjusting my chair to support my back will also improve posture.  

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?  
I can sit upright with shoulders relaxed, take regular breaks to stand and stretch, and follow the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain.  

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks?  
I can use Focus Bear’s movement reminders to schedule breaks throughout the day. Setting phone alerts or sticky notes on my desk can also remind me to adjust posture and stretch.  

Workspace Adjustment: I raised my laptop using a stack of books as a temporary stand and connected an external keyboard and mouse to keep my wrists neutral.  
Equipment to Improve Posture: A proper laptop stand or ergonomic chair would further improve comfort.  
Movement Reminders: I enabled Focus Bear’s movement break reminders for a full day and noticed less stiffness in my neck and shoulders.  
Habit Change: I now check my posture every hour and consciously adjust to sit upright.
