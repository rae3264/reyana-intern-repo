Common Cyber Security Threats in Remote Work
- Phishing emails and malicious links  
- Weak or reused passwords  
- Unsecured Wi-Fi networks  
- Malware from unsafe downloads  
- Unauthorized access from unattended devices  

Best Practices for Device & Account Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for each account  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible  
- Keep software and systems updated  
- Use a password manager instead of reusing passwords  
- Connect only through secure, private Wi-Fi networks  
- Lock your computer whenever stepping away  

Importance of Locking Your Computer
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive files  
- Protects company and user data if your device is left unattended  
- Reduces the risk of accidental or malicious data leaks  

Handling Phishing & Suspicious Links
- Do not click on unexpected or suspicious links  
- Verify the sender before responding to emails  
- Report phishing attempts immediately to the security team  
- Use company-approved security tools to scan attachments if needed  

Strong Password Practices
- Minimum of 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols  
- Avoid personal info (birthdays, names, common words)  
- Use a password manager to generate and store passwords securely  

Importance of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Adds an extra layer of protection if your password is compromised  
- Prevents unauthorized logins, even if credentials are leaked  
- Should be enabled on all work-related accounts and critical services  

Current Security Measures I Follow  
- Using unique and strong passwords for most accounts  
- Locking my devices when away  
- Being cautious with suspicious emails and links  
- Keeping my software updated  

Areas for Improvement  
- Consistently using a password manager across all accounts  
- Enabling 2FA on every possible work account  

Making Secure Behavior a Habit  
- Set automatic device locks after a few minutes of inactivity  
- Use Focus Bear reminders or calendar prompts to perform regular security checks  
- Treat every email and link with skepticism until verified  

Steps to Secure My Passwords & Accounts  
- Store all credentials in a password manager  
- Rotate critical account passwords every few months  
- Enable 2FA everywhere possible  

If I Suspected a Breach or Suspicious Activity  
1. Immediately report it to the security officer/manager  
2. Disconnect the affected device from the internet  
3. Change account passwords and review account activity  
4. Document the incident for internal review
