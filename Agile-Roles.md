Roles in an Agile Team

Key Roles in an Agile Team

Developers: Responsible for building, coding, and delivering the product features. They transform user stories into working software. 

Quality Assurance (QA): Ensures that the product meets quality standards by writing test cases, running tests, and identifying bugs before release.  

Product Manager (PM): Defines the product vision, manages the product backlog, prioritizes features, and ensures the team is building the right things to meet user needs.  

Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) / Scrum Master: Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, ensures Agile principles are followed, and supports the teamâ€™s productivity.  

Supporting Roles (Stakeholders, UX, Customer Support): Stakeholders provide direction and input, UX focuses on usability and design, and customer support gives feedback on user pain points to guide improvements.  

Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum
In Scrum, roles collaborate within time-boxed sprints, with defined ceremonies (planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives) that encourage structured communication and alignment. In Kanban, collaboration is more continuous, with team members pulling tasks as capacity allows and maintaining workflow visibility. While Scrum has more formal roles and ceremonies, Kanban focuses on flexibility and ongoing prioritization, requiring strong communication and self-organization among all roles.


My Role and Contribution to Agile
My role is to contribute to the Agile process by ensuring my work is visible on the Kanban board, delivering tasks efficiently, and keeping the team informed during stand-ups. I focus on collaboration, transparency, and adaptability, which helps maintain steady workflow and progress.

Interaction with Other Roles
My responsibilities often overlap with developers and QA. For example, I may need to coordinate with developers to ensure tasks are progressing smoothly and with QA to confirm that deliverables meet quality standards. This collaboration ensures that work is completed effectively and with minimal rework.


Role Description: Within the Agile team, my role as a Cybersecurity Analyst ensures that security considerations are integrated into every stage of development. I monitor risks, conduct vulnerability assessments, and collaborate with the team to resolve security issues promptly.  

Collaboration Improvement: I frequently collaborate with developers. To improve teamwork, I can share security best practices more proactively and provide clear, actionable feedback during backlog refinement or stand-ups. This will help developers address potential risks earlier and reduce security-related rework later.
