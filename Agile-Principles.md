What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?  
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management that focuses on delivering value quickly and continuously adapting to change. Unlike traditional project management (often called "Waterfall"), which follows a rigid, sequential process, Agile allows teams to respond to new requirements, feedback, and changing priorities throughout the development cycle.

What are the core values and principles of Agile?  
The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:  
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

Its principles promote iterative delivery, sustainable pace, continuous improvement, and close collaboration with stakeholders.

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?  
- Scrum: Time-boxed sprints (1‚Äì4 weeks) with defined ceremonies (planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives). Best when projects benefit from structured cycles and predictable goals.  
- Kanban: Continuous flow system where tasks move across a visual board (e.g., Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done). Best when flexibility is needed, and priorities change frequently.  

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?  
Focus Bear prefers Kanban because it allows greater flexibility to adapt priorities as the team works on fast-moving features. Kanban‚Äôs continuous flow approach fits better with smaller, evolving teams where work items vary in scope and urgency.

What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?  
The biggest benefits of Agile are adaptability, faster delivery of value, and strong collaboration across roles. It ensures work aligns closely with user needs. However, challenges include managing changing priorities, ensuring consistent communication in distributed teams, and balancing flexibility with structure.  

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?  
Agile principles can improve my role by encouraging continuous feedback, transparency, and regular prioritization of tasks. This ensures I focus on high-value activities and adjust quickly to new requirements while maintaining accountability within the team.



### üõ†Ô∏è Task

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words:  
Scrum uses fixed-length sprints with structured meetings and clear sprint goals, while Kanban is more fluid, with tasks continuously pulled from the backlog and moved across the board. Scrum works best for teams needing predictability and cadence, whereas Kanban is ideal when priorities shift often and the team needs flexibility.
