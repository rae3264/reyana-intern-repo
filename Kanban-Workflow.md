How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage work by tracking tasks as they move through different stages of completion. It helps teams visualize their workflow, identify bottlenecks, and maintain a steady pace of progress. By making tasks visible, it ensures everyone is aware of priorities and responsibilities.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? 
Typical columns on a Kanban board include:  
- Backlog – Tasks that are planned but not yet started.  
- In Progress – Tasks actively being worked on.  
- Blocked – Tasks that cannot proceed due to an issue or dependency.  
- Done – Completed tasks.  

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?  
Tasks move from left to right across the board as they progress through the workflow. The person responsible for working on the task is also responsible for updating its status, ensuring transparency and accountability.

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)? 
Limiting WIP helps prevent overload by reducing multitasking, which allows team members to focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones. This improves efficiency, ensures higher quality work, and helps identify bottlenecks more easily.


How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban makes priorities clear by showing which tasks are in progress and which are waiting. By limiting WIP, it ensures the team does not spread itself too thin, reducing stress and enabling faster completion of important tasks. This creates a more balanced and sustainable workflow.  

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow by setting personal WIP limits, focusing on completing tasks before taking on new ones, and regularly reviewing the board to adjust priorities. This will help me stay organized and avoid getting stuck with too many half-finished tasks.
