AI Tools Typically Used for My Role (Cybersecurity Analyst)
- Automated threat detection and monitoring tools  
- AI-based log analysis and anomaly detection  
- AI-driven vulnerability scanning and patch prioritization  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for analyzing phishing emails  
- Generative AI for drafting security policies, reports, and awareness training  

Benefits of AI in Professional Settings  
- Increases efficiency by automating repetitive tasks  
- Enhances accuracy in detecting anomalies and potential threats  
- Provides faster insights and recommendations for decision-making  
- Supports better communication with generated drafts or summaries  

Risks of Using AI  
- Risk of exposing confidential or sensitive data if entered into public AI tools  
- Potential bias or inaccuracies in AI-generated output  
- Over-reliance leading to reduced critical thinking and expertise  
- Limited explainability of AI-driven decisions ("black box" problem)  

Information That Should Never Be Entered into AI Tools  
- Personally identifiable information (PII)  
- Sensitive company data (e.g., financial records, user data, strategy documents)

- Validate technical accuracy with industry standards or internal documentation  
- Apply human judgment and expertise before finalizing any output  
- Treat AI output as a draft or suggestion, not a final truth  


## üìù Reflection

When to Use AI for Assistance vs. My Own Skills  
- I will use AI for brainstorming, drafting reports, summarizing long documents, or analyzing trends.  
- I will rely on my own expertise for decision-making, threat assessments, and handling sensitive data.  

Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI  
- I will treat AI as a supportive tool, not a replacement for my expertise.  
- I will always review and critically evaluate AI outputs before using them.  

Steps to Ensure Data Privacy When Using AI Tools  
- Never enter confidential or sensitive information into external AI platforms.  
- Use company-approved AI tools with proper security controls.  
- Anonymize or redact sensitive details before seeking AI assistance.  


AI Task Chosen: Drafting an initial outline for a cybersecurity awareness training document.  
- Result: AI generated a useful draft with structured topics, but I had to fact-check certain details and adapt the language to Focus Bear‚Äôs context.  

Best Practice to Follow at Focus Bear:  
Always treat AI-generated content as a draft that requires review, editing, and fact-checking before sharing or implementing.
