Experiences with Great Teamwork and Professionalism  
I have witnessed teamwork where everyone communicated respectfully, listened actively, and supported one another. It was effective because team members felt valued, and work was completed efficiently.  

Steps to Ensure Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication  
I will use polite language, actively listen to others, respond thoughtfully to messages, and avoid assumptions or judgment.  

Creating a Positive, Fun, and Professional Environment  
I can contribute by encouraging collaboration, celebrating team successes, keeping interactions lighthearted yet respectful, and maintaining accountability for my tasks.  

Preparing for Meetings  
I will review relevant updates, prepare questions, and document discussion points beforehand. This ensures meetings are focused and productive.  

Being Proactive During the Internship  
I will anticipate needs, update supervisors and colleagues regularly, volunteer for tasks, and identify potential issues before they escalate.  

Following Up and Escalating  
I will politely follow up with colleagues or supervisors if information or actions are pending. If no response is received after a reasonable timeframe, I will escalate to the next appropriate manager or contact the CEO in cases of major professional conduct breaches.  

Things I Will Avoid  
I will avoid unprofessional behaviours such as gossiping, ignoring messages, making negative comments about colleagues, or missing deadlines without notice.
