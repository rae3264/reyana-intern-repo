What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear sets itself apart by combining habit-building routines with focus tools in a single app. While Freedom and Cold Turkey mainly block distractions, and Tiimo and Routinery lean more toward structured planning or habit scheduling, Focus Bear integrates both approaches. It doesn’t just remove distractions—it guides users toward productive behaviors through routine prompts and micro-habits. From a cybersecurity lens, Focus Bear is also lighter in terms of system permissions compared to apps like Cold Turkey, which require deep system-level access to block apps/sites.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
As a user, I would choose Focus Bear if I value a balanced approach between blocking distractions and building positive routines. Competitors like Freedom are great for strict focus sessions, but they don’t help much with daily rituals like morning routines, workouts, or mindfulness. Focus Bear feels more like a personal coach than just a blocker. From a security/privacy angle, I would also choose Focus Bear if I prefer an app that operates with minimal system intrusion, reducing risks of over-privileged access.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Cold Turkey and Freedom have a “locked mode” or “forced blocking” feature that makes it nearly impossible to bypass distractions once a session has started. Focus Bear currently allows more flexibility, which can be helpful—but it also makes it easier to give in to procrastination.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Focus Bear could benefit from adding an optional “hard lock mode” similar to Cold Turkey—where once a focus session is started, the user cannot disable or quit until the timer ends. This would make Focus Bear more appealing to users who struggle with discipline and want stronger accountability. From a cybersecurity perspective, implementing this with transparent permissions (without excessive system control) would maintain user trust while still delivering strong distraction blocking.
